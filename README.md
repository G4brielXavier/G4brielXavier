<p>Hello, My name is Gabriel Xavier, I'm 18 years old, I have programming experience for over 6 years, with JavaScript and Python, but my focus on JS is over and my focus now is to leave the Front-end and go to the deeper layer Back-end alongside Python.</p>
<p>I have been studying and practicing <code>Python</code> for 6 months, using a Roadmap to facilitate each subject necessary to learn, I want to focus on Back-end, DataScience, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, I want to specialize in the area of ​​Artificial Intelligence .</p>

<p>God goes before everything, Amen.</p>
